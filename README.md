# bnetza-rufzeichenliste-parser
A nodejs script to extract every assigned amateur radio callsign from the PDF list published by the German Federal Network Agency into a CSV file.

Run the script:
```javascript
npm install
npm run
```

At the moment only callsigns and no other information will be extracted from the PDF. They will be written to `callsigns.csv`
